<div class="paragraph">
<p>In cooperation with the Food Crusaders, The Environmental Council has developed a composting system and plans to expand it. The 
composters are located on the ground floor, outside the outdoor eating area. The environmental council encourages younger EAG
class representatives to take part in the transportation of food waste to the composters on a monthly basis. The remaining 
compost can be used to grow plants around the school.</p>

<p>The environmental council will continue the use of EnTrak, which monitors the energy usage of the school. This will be done
in order to raise more awareness of energy consumption throught the school, and to indentify sources of energy consumption, most 
notably air conditioning, and develop policies to mitigate the effects of energy consumption by these devices.</p>

<p>The environmental council is also planning to implement solar panels across the school as an alternate source of green energy. 
However, it is only feasible to only depend partly on solar power due to its inefficiency and the annual weather conditions in Hong
Kong.</p>
