<img class="topic-images" src="pictures/recruitment.PNG">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications for the environmental council happen on a bi-annual basis, once during October in Term 1 and another time in 
April in Term 3. Once the student's application is accepted and they pass the interview, they are granted a role in the council 
as a core member. To advance further up in the Environmental Council, the Chiarperson and the Department heads identify exceptional 
council members, they are then voted on by the Leadership Council, and if successful, they may be granted a position as deputy or 
shadow head of a certain department, taking over the head of the department when they leave STC or resign from the environmental council.</p>
