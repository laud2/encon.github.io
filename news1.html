<p><span class="boldtext">The council starts a new year afresh in this first meeting of 2019-2020, with many members leaving and many 
recruits joining.</span> This year's Chairperson is Solomon Lam (12D1), with Yin Wai Kwong as Executive Director. This year, the council 
has reorganised itself to create new departments and new positions, with 8 departments, each with their own head, and along with the 
Chairperson, Executive Director and Head of Support Ops, creates a total of 11 positions in the Leadership Council. Each position in the 
Leadership Council has a deputy head from a lower year group for their department, who will become head of department once the already 
existing head of department finishes Year 12. <br> We plan to continue upholding the ESF Sustainability Guidelines within the school 
this academic year. See <span class="boldtext">Documents (under About Us)</span> for more details. <br> This year, we plan to implement 
plants in every classroom, solar panels, a fully fledged composting sytem among others, see <span class="boldtext">Our Projects </span>
for more details. <br>The council looks forward to working with all the new council members this year. If you couldn't get into the 
council, you may try to apply again in Term 3.</p>
